What are Python Data Structures (Lists, Sets, and Tuples)?
The basic Python data structures in Python include list, set, tuples, and dictionary. Each of the data structures is unique in its own way. Data structures are “containers” that organize and group data according to type.

Python Data Structures - Lists, Sets, and Tuples

The data structures differ based on mutability and order. Mutability refers to the ability to change an object after its creation. Mutable objects can be modified, added, or deleted after they’ve been created, while immutable objects cannot be modified after their creation. Order, in this context, relates to whether the position of an element can be used to access the element.
