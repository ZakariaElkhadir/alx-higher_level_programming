# Python Test-Driven Development (TDD) README

## Overview

This repository provides a guide and examples for practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The process involves writing a test, implementing the code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code if necessary. TDD helps in producing high-quality, maintainable code with a focus on the requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-test-driven-development.git
cd python-test-driven-development
```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure for a Python project:

```plaintext
python-test-driven-development/
|-- src/
|   |-- your_module/
|   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   |-- your_code.py
|-- tests/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- test_your_code.py
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.md
|-- requirements.txt
|-- setup.py
```

- `src/`: Contains the source code of your project.
- `tests/`: Contains the test cases for your code.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- `README.md`: The documentation you are currently reading.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
- `setup.py`: Configures the installation of the project.

## Writing Tests

Tests are written using the `unittest` module in Python. Create test files in the `tests/` directory following the naming convention `test_*.py`. For example, `test_your_code.py` for testing `your_code.py`. 

Here is a basic example of a test:

```python
# tests/test_your_code.py

import unittest
from your_module.your_code import add

class TestYourCode(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add(self):
        result = add(2, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)
```

## Running Tests

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

This will discover and run all test cases in the `tests/` directory.

## Continuous Integration

Configure a continuous integration (CI) system to automatically run the tests on each commit. Popular CI services include Travis CI, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. Include a configuration file (e.g., `.travis.yml` or `.github/workflows/tests.yml`) in your project for CI.

## Best Practices

- Write simple and atomic tests.
- Follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle: Write a failing test, implement the code to make it pass, and then refactor if needed.
- Keep tests independent of each other.
- Use meaningful test and function names.
- Aim for full test coverage but focus on critical paths.
- Strive for clean and readable code in both tests and production code.
